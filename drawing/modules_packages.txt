#To structure your modules, you can group them into packages. A package is basically just another type of module.
#The interesting thing about them is that they can contain other modules. While a module is stored in a file(with
#file name extension .py). a package is a directory. To make Python treat it as a package, it must contain a file(module) named
#__init__.py. The content of that file will be contents of the package, if you import it as if it were a plain module. 


#To put modules inside a package, simply put the module files inside the package directory.
